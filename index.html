      <dt>Who's behind this shenanigan?</dt>

      <dt>What's the theme of the conference? Why is it called "Renaissance Code"?</dt>
      <dd>
        Taking inspiration from the polymaths of the Scientific Revolution like Da Vinci and Galileo,
        Renaissance Code aims to combine programming with science,
        philosophy, engineering, psychology, linguistics, art, design, economics,
        and perhaps a splash of Miller High Life.
        "We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time."
